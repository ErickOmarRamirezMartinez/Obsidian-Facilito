# Built-in React Hooks

_Hooks_ let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.

## State Hooks [](https://es.react.dev/reference/react/hooks#state-hooks "Link for State Hooks")

_State_ lets a component [«remember» information like user input.](https://es.react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.

To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:

- [`useState`](https://es.react.dev/reference/react/useState) declares a state variable that you can update directly.
- [`useReducer`](https://es.react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) declares a state variable with the update logic inside a [reducer function.](https://es.react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

```
function ImageGallery() {  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);  // ...
```
