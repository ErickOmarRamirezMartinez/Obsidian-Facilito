[useNavigation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigation#usenavigation)

This hook tells you everything you need to know about a page navigation to build pending navigation indicators and optimistic UI on data mutations. Things like:

- Global loading indicators
- Disabling forms while a mutation is happening
- Adding busy indicators to submit buttons
- Optimistically showing a new record while it's being created on the server
- Optimistically showing the new state of a record while it's being updated
